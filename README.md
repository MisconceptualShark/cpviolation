# CP Violation 

4th Year Project - CP Violation in and beyond the standard model  

## Current progress

- [x] Source learning 
    - working with Alex to learn the physics of the standard model
    - must understand before we can move on to specifying project

- [x] Interim report
    - mid report found in subfolder
    - performed on 2HDM space for certain parameters, followed 0907.5135 on arxiv

- [x] Choose specific project
    - going into further flavour observable calculation for 2HDM, now with SM4

- [ ] Work on full project
    - figure out what observables need more calculation
    - statistical fits need sorted
