# CP Violation 

4th Year Project - CP Violation in and beyond the standard model  

## Current progress

- [ ] Source learning 
    - working with Alex to learn the physics of the standard model
    - must understand before we can move on to specifying project ![Main scattering reaction to be understood](/notes/bmes.png "Innacuracy explanation")

- [ ] Choose specific project
    - decide what sort of route to take - simulation, data analysis, theory calculation etc
